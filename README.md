# VelocityVerlet_sim
Classical mechanics 3 body problem simulation using Velocity Verlet approximation:
The first part of the code are the initial conditions of the system, then there is a local function that will be an input to the global function.
The global function solves the differential equation of motion using the velocity verlet method.
